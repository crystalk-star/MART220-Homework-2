I ran into a lot of issues with this one. I couldn't figure out how to randomize locations, 
and I couldn't move shapes besides circles. When I tried to make a "myCircle" class, it would tell me I wasn't defining
the "myCircle", for example I had

var theCircle

function setup()
  theCircle = new myCircle(100,200,45,134,34,39);

function draw()

class myCircle 
{

  constructor(x,y,diameter,red,green,blue,speed)
  {
     this.x = x;
     this.y = y;
     this.diameter = diameter;
    this.red = red;
    this.green = green;
    this.blue = blue;
    this.speed = speed;
  }
  
  display()
  {
     fill(this.red,this.green,this.blue);
     circle(this.x,this.y, this.diameter); 
  }
  
  movement()
  { //print(x);
    if(this.x >= width-this.diameter/2 || this.x<= this.diameter/2)
    {
      print("words")
      speed*=-1;
    }
            this.x+=speed;
  }

and when I tried to make a circle it would just keep saying it wasn't defined. I have a counter in place but wasn't
sure how to make it change shape when it hit a certain number. I think I want an array with different shapes in it
so I can call those shapes into the draw function when the counter hits 1000, but I'm not sure how to put that 
in coding terms.

Is there additional resources I could study to try and understand more about what was asked?
